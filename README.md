# YouTube Shorts Redirect
YouTube shorts are annoying. You can't rewind, fast-forward, and scrub in the timeline, so if you missed something in the video, you are forced to watch it all over again. This userscript will redirect YouTube shorts to use the default YouTube video player instead. It does not save or share any of your data.

Inspired by the [YouTube Shorts Block Chrome extension](https://github.com/doma-itachi/Youtube-shorts-block/tree/master).

Unfortunately, that extension only works on Chromium browsers, so I wrote this userscript as a more universal solution to redirect those pesky YouTube shorts. Tested in Safari. This should work on both desktop and mobile browsers (no promises though!)

## Installation
Use your preferred userscript manager (e.g. Tampermonkey).

Go to my [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/472376-youtube-shorts-redirect) page.

Alternatively, paste this [direct link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennett-zhang/youtube-shorts-redirect/main/src/youtube-shorts-redirect.user.js) into your userscript manager.
